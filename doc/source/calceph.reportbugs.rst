.. _`Reporting bugs`:

Reporting bugs
**************


If you think you have found a bug in the |LIBRARYNAME|, first have a look on the |LIBRARYNAME| web page http://www.imcce.fr/inpop, in which case you may find there a workaround for it. Otherwise, please investigate and report it. We have made this library available to you, and it seems very important for us, to ask you to report the bugs that you find.

There are a few things you should think about when you put your bug report together.
You have to send us a test case that makes it possible for us to reproduce the bug. Include instructions on the way to run the test case.

You also have to explain what is wrong; if you get a crash, or if the results printed are incorrect and in that case, in what way.

Please include compiler version information in your bug report. This can be extracted using *cc -V* on some machines, or, if you're using gcc, *gcc -v*. Also, include the output from *uname -a* and the |LIBRARYSHORTNAME| version.

Send your bug report to: |EMAIL|.
If you think something in this manual is unclear, or downright incorrect, or if the language needs to be improved, please send a note to the same address.
