| The units of PV. 
| This integer is a sum of some unit constants (CALCEPH_UNIT\_???) and/or the constant |CALCEPH_USE_NAIFID|.
| If the unit contains |CALCEPH_USE_NAIFID|, the NAIF identification numbering system is used for the target (:ref:`NAIF identification numbers` for the list). 
| If the unit does not contain |CALCEPH_USE_NAIFID|, the old number system is used for the target (see the list in the function |calceph_compute|).
