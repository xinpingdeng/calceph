| An array to receive the euler angles and their derivatives for the orientation of the body. 
| The derivatives of the angles are expressed in days if unit contains |CALCEPH_UNIT_DAY|.
| The derivatives of the angles are expressed in seconds if unit contains |CALCEPH_UNIT_SEC|.
| The angles of the librations of the Moon are expressed in radians if unit contains |CALCEPH_UNIT_RAD|.
