| An array to receive the cartesian position (x,y,z) and the velocity (xdot, ydot, zdot). 
| The position is expressed in Astronomical Unit (au) and the velocity is expressed in Astronomical Unit per day (au/day).                                                 
| If the target is *TT-TDB*, only the first element of this array will get the result. The time scale transformation TT-TDB is expressed in seconds.
| If the target is *TCG-TCB*, only the first element of this array will get the result. The time scale transformation TCG-TCB is expressed in seconds.
| If the target is *Librations*, the angles of the librations of the Moon are expressed in radians and their derivatives are expressed in radians per day.
