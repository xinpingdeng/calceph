| An array to receive the angular momentum due to its rotation, divided by the product of the mass and of the square of the radius, and the derivatives, of the body.
| The angular momentum and its derivatives are expressed in days if unit contains |CALCEPH_UNIT_DAY|.
| The angular momentum and its derivatives are expressed in seconds if unit contains |CALCEPH_UNIT_SEC|.
