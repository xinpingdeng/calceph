The order of derivatives.

 * = 0 , only the angles is computed. The first three numbers of PVAJ are valid for the results. 
 * = 1 , only the angles and the first derivative are computed. The first six numbers of PVAJ are valid for the results. 
 * = 2 , only the angles and the first and second derivatives are computed. The first nine numbers of PVAJ are valid for the results. 
 * = 3 , the angles and the first, second and third derivatives  are computed. The first twelve numbers of PVAJ are valid for the results. 

If order equals to 1, the behavior of |calceph_orient_order| is the same as |calceph_orient_unit|.
