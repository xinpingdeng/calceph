  \brief Example of usage of the multiple file access functions.
         This example reads the constant EMRAT, AU, GM_Mer and print their values.
         It computes for a date
          the geocentric moon coordinates, 
          the value TT-TDB 
          the heliocentric coordinates of Mars.
